user_description: I am a second year Masters of Environmental Management student open to employment opportunities, new ventures, and collaborations. My current work uses data to mobilize green venture capital to accelerate the transition to a decarbonized, less toxic, and more just society. I do this by connecting green chemistry, the circular economy, and data-driven decision making using a systems thinking framework.
