user_description: I am a second year Masters of Environmental student open to employment opportunities, new ventures, and collaborations. My work uses data to mobilize green venture capital to accelerate the transition to a decarbonized, less toxic, and just society. I do this by connecting systems thinking, the circular economy, and data-driven decision making. I excel at encouraging dialogue between disciplines. I can connect with activists, the boardroom, and most everyone between. Everyone is trying their best to build a better life and deserves respect. We have an immense risk and an even larger opportunity. Let's get to work.
